# Render Protocol Spec

### Render Protocol specifications, contracts and definitions in protobuf for gRPC communication

---

## Overview

This repository serves as the **canonical source of truth** for the Render Protocol’s
**specifications, contracts, and schema definitions**.

It is designed to define **language-agnostic, versioned protobuf contracts** that enable
reliable and efficient communication between Render Protocol clients and servers using
**gRPC**.

---

## Purpose

The primary intent of this repository is to:

- Define **protocol-level contracts** for Render Protocol
- Establish a **stable, strongly-typed interface** between clients and servers
- Enable consistent behavior across multiple platforms and implementations
- Act as the foundation for **server-driven UI (SDUI)** communication

This repository **does not contain any runtime or business logic**.

---

## Scope (Initial Phase)

At the current stage, this repository exists to establish **structure and intent** only.

Detailed specifications, schemas, and API definitions will be introduced **after the core
architecture and protocol design are finalized**.

---

## Non-Goals

- No server implementations
- No client SDKs
- No generated code
- No tooling or code-generation setup at this stage

Those concerns will be handled in their respective repositories.

---

## Status

🚧 **Early stage / Planning phase**

The contents of this repository will evolve as the Render Protocol architecture matures.

---

## Related Repositories

This repository is part of the broader **Render Protocol** ecosystem, which includes:

- Client renderers (SwiftUI, Flutter, Compose)
- Server implementations
- Supporting tooling and infrastructure

Details will be linked once available.
